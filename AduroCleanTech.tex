Video was done 8 months ago

\begin{itemize}
  \item ADURO not making revenue (at first Mariusz as not interested because of it)

  \item ADURO claims to solve a problem that is says to have a 2025 deadline,
    even though there are no revenues, the idea to solve this problem transforms
    this to a more attractive investment

  \item What is the problem? Plastic 
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item Plastic is becoming one of the most problematic component for the
        environment
      \item By 2025, there is a deadline for the big plastic producers to reduce
        the plastic consumption and recycling 
    \end{enumerate}
  \item ADURO, has created a new approach to manage plastic consumption. 
    uses the 80\% that nobody else can process in order to recycle it, around 20\% of the
    plastic is easy to manage and recycle, but there are no other competitors
    that can manage that 80\% of plastic. Is a technology based on water.
