\section{ADURO}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Ofer Vicus (CEO)
  \item Public since 2021
  \item They have been doing R\&D for 10 years until they recently went public
  \item ADURO not making revenue (at first Mariusz as not interested because of it)

  \item ADURO claims to solve a problem that is says to have a 2025 deadline,
    even though there are no revenues, the idea to solve this problem transforms
    this to a more attractive investment

  \item What is the problem? Plastic 
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item Plastic is becoming one of the most problematic component for the
        environment
      \item By 2025, there is a deadline for the big plastic producers to reduce
        the plastic consumption and recycling 
    \end{enumerate}
  \item ADURO, has created a new approach to manage plastic consumption. 
    uses the 80\% that nobody else can process in order to recycle it, around 20\% of the
    plastic is easy to manage and recycle, but there are no other competitors
    that can manage that 80\% of plastic. Is a technology based on water.
  \item Many big players (as he called them) are already interested in ADURO,
    and each of the interested parties can return millions of dollars each
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Proposed Business Model}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Licensing model
    Customer puts out their own factory or recycling facility and ADURO charges a licensing fee, (highest in returns)
  \item Own Producing Model
    ADURO setup their own recycling facility 
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Margin of Safety (How much money can I loose?)}
Things that provides Mariusz margin of safety
\begin{itemize}
  \item Insiders (of the company) own 48\% of the company, so there is a
    pressure to succeed
  \item The patents are owned by them
  \item Cost of patents
  \item Scientists backup the technology used by ADURO

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Market Today and Forecast}
